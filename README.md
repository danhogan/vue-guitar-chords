Guitar Chord Diagrams in VueJS

Provides an SVG-backed component to create guitar chord diagrams.

e.g.
```html
<guitar-chord name="G chord" nut-position="0"
        tuning="EADGBE" :fretted="gChordNotes">
</guitar-chord>

<script>
var gChordNotes = [
        { string: 0, fret: 3, finger: 2 },
        { string: 1, fret: 2, finger: 1 },
        { string: 4, fret: 3, finger: 3 },
        { string: 5, fret: 3, finger: 4 },
];
</script>
```

## Installation

This project was just for fun, I haven't really paid attention to setting it up properly to be distributed, and in the time that I haven't worked on it, there are surely things that need updating.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
